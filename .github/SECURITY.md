```
Subject: [SECURITY] Vulnerability in ops0 Container Execution

Description:
A potential code injection vulnerability in the @ops0.step decorator 
when processing untrusted user input...

Impact:
An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code in the container 
environment if they can control the function parameters...

Reproduction Steps:
1. Create a pipeline with @ops0.step
2. Pass malicious input: payload = "'; rm -rf /; #"
3. Observe code execution...

Environment:
- ops0 version: 0.1.5

## 🎓 Security Best Practices

### For ops0 Users

#### 🔒 Secure Pipeline Development
```python
import ops0

# ✅ Good: Use environment variables for secrets
@ops0.step
def secure_api_call():
    api_key = os.environ.get('API_KEY')  # From secure env
    return make_request(api_key)

# ❌ Bad: Hardcoded secrets
@ops0.step  
def insecure_api_call():
    api_key = "sk-1234567890abcdef"  # Never do this!
    return make_request(api_key)
```

#### 🛡️ Input Validation
```python
@ops0.step
def process_user_data(user_input: str):
    # ✅ Good: Validate and sanitize input
    if not isinstance(user_input, str):
        raise ValueError("Invalid input type")
    
    sanitized = sanitize_input(user_input)
    return process(sanitized)
```

#### 📊 Secure Data Handling
```python
@ops0.step
def handle_sensitive_data(data):
    # ✅ Good: Use ops0's secure storage
    ops0.storage.save_secure("processed_data", data, encrypt=True)
    
    # Clear sensitive data from memory
    del data
    gc.collect()
```
